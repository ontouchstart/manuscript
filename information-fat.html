      Information Fat (2026/01/22)
    </h1>
    <p>
      I have been catching up with reading
      during the precious downtime between jobs,
      on a large Kindle Scribe that allows me to read full screen PDF.
      Yesterday I was rereading 
      <i>The Story of the Human Body: Evolution, Health, and Disease</i>
      by Daniel E. Lieberman (2013). 
      I jumped to Part III, Chapter 10: The Vicious Circle of Too Much
      (location 4207 of 11,117 | 38%). It has some interesting discussion about how 
      human species became so efficient at storing energy as body fat due to natual selection
      and why obesity becomes an issue in modern days due to <b>low quality high energy</b> diet.
      This is the knowledge I already had when I started long distance running since COVID.

      At the lunch break, I went to Hacker News and got sucked 
      into a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46707572">rabbit hole</a>.
      The discussion has more than 500 comments and someone posted links to more documents
      about the background of the document they are discussing about. 
      Out of curiosity, I downloaded the one day old  PDF/epub from  
      <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-new-constitution">Anthropic</a>,
      the three year old PDF from 
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073">Arxiv</a>, 
      and the two month old 
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/Richard-Weiss/efe157692991535403bd7e7fb20b6695">gist</a>.
      When I open them on Kindle Scribe with the smallest font, 
      <i>Claude's Constitution</i> (ePub) has 1,1584 locations,
      <i>Claude's Constitution</i> (PDF) has 84 pages,
      <i>arXiv:2212.08073v1 [cs.CL] 15 Dec 2022</i> has 34 pages,
      <i>Claude 4.5 Opus Soul Document</i> (gist) has 1,736 locations.

      I can't help noticing that each these documents is about 1/10 of a full book. They do take a lot of
      <b>energy</b> to create and consume. I am sure the percentage of people who commented on that 
      Hacker News rabbit hole and actually read through at least one of those three documents is
      very small, our brain just don't have <b>energy</b> to consume that amount of information. 
      I have spent weeks to finish the Lieberman book and I am sure it took years for Dr. Lieberman
      to write it.

      Now we are in the age of cheap low quality information, nobody has energy to digest and so we just
      store them everywhere as information fat.
