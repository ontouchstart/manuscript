Teleology vs Causality 

I have been reading philosophy recently and 
thinking about the relation between teleology (pulled by purpose) and causality (pushes by cause).

George Dyson's "Turing's Cathedral" has 
some discussion about a 1943 paper by Julian 
Bigelow and Norbert Wiener, "Behavior, 
Purpose and Teleology". In the context of 
that paper, teleology means "negative 
feedback". This is the essence of cybernetics
from thermostats all the way to LLMs. 

I have never noticed the connection between 
teleology and negative feedback. This is 
fascinating. 

In a goal driven model, we do not try to
explain why or how as long as we know there
is a goal and some loss function to minimize.

On the other hand, in a causality model, we
have differential equations and initial and
boundary conditions, we will solve the 
equations analytically or numerically.

Teleological models fix human psychology well
because we work to the goal. For example,
Moore's law is a teleological law, unlike
Newton's causal laws of physics, the scaling
is to meet the expectation and maximization 
of commercial profit.

The AI in the current form of LLMs is fundamentally teleological. So don't aks why.
