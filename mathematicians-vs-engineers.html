    Mathematicians vs Engineers (2026/01/27)

      "Von Neumann's approach was to bring a handful of engineers into a
      den of mathematicians, rather than a handful of mathematicians into
      a den of engineers. This freed the project from any constraints
      that might have been imposed by an established group of engineers
      with preexisting opinions as to how a computer should be built."
