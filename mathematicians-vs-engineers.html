    Mathematicians vs Engineers (2026/01/27)

      "Von Neumann's approach was to bring a handful of engineers into a
      den of mathematicians, rather than a handful of mathematicians into
      a den of engineers. This freed the project from any constraints
      that might have been imposed by an established group of engineers
      with preexisting opinions as to how a computer should be built."

      "The MANIAC’s logical architecture was indisputably the work of
      Burks, Goldstine, and von Neumann, whatever their ideas’ original
      source. Its physical implementation was indisputably the work of
      Bigelow, and its electronic design was largely the result of teamwork
      between Bigelow, Pomerene, Rosenberg, Slutz, and Ware."

      "Go ahead, nothing else matters, get it running at this speed and
      this capability, and the rest of it is just a lot of nonsense."

      "You could never tell whether he was doing it because he was seeking
      perfection or because he was worried about reliability."
