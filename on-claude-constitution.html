    <p>
      If we take out most of the PR/propaganda and ideology buzzwords,
      what is left in the <i>Claude's Constitution</i>?
      Let's consider those words, sentences and paragraphs as meta data instead
      of real content.
      Since the document is consumed by human as PR/propaganda as well as LLMs
      as pattern match training data, the content free buzzwords are more
      more important than the content itself.
      Because words like "constitution", "safety", 
      "harmless", "honesty", "helpful" do trigger emotional response from layman, 
      and acronyms like <b>RLHF</b>, <b>SL-CAI</b>, <b>CoT</b>, <b>HHH</b> add
      authoritative voice. 
      These meta data get fed back to LLM training and human interaction,
      amplified by orders of magnitudes and drowned the real content. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this "consitution" is used in <b>SL-CAI</b> for Claude models,
      these buzzwords and patterns will propagate the cyberspace as virus and 
      lose their true meanings.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the core idea behind <b>SL-CAI</b> without the buzzword?
    </p>
    <p>
      From the paper <i><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073">
      Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback</a></i>,
      it is <b>RLAIF</b> (RL from AI Feedback), replace <b>H</b> with <b>AI</b>
      in <b>RLHF</b> to scale supervision, cut expensive "non-scalable" staff
      and workers at Surge AI, Amazon MTurk, and Upwork out of the loop. 
      AI supervisors will use "Constitution" to decide <b>HHH</b> of the output
      of the model (Claude).
    </p>
    <p>
      This looks like a great idea! Since LLMs can generate,
      why can't they supervise?
