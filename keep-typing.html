    Keep typing.
    If we need a new paragraph,
    wrap it with a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag.
    <p>
      It is not that complicated.

      What is a manuscript?
      Based on Wikipedia
      (I am not going to add link here because this page is meant for reading on
      some off-line device such a kindle (no body prints to paper anymore).
      You can easily take out a smart phone and let AI agent do the work
      without breaking the chain of thoughts),
      the word is derived from latin, <i>manūscriptum</i>: <i>manus</i> (hand)
      and <i>scriptum</i> from <i>scribere</i> (to write).
      So a manuscript is made by the author "by hand",
      for themselves and their editors.
    </p>
    <p>
      A writer should put effort in thinking and composing than fighting through
      rabbit holes of <i>styling</i>, <i>formatting</i> and <i>publishing</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we ignore most of the styling (including structure styling like heading,
      listing, etc), only keep essential tags such as 
      <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>,
      <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>,
      <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>,
      <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>, and
      <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>,
      the HTML would be easy to parse by human and machine.
      We don't need the extra step of converting markdown format to HTML.
      <i>Markdown</i> is popular now in documentation and LLM because machine
      generated HTML is so complex that nobody would dare to read the source,
      unless you are a professional <i>Web Developer</i>.
      Nobody writes manuscript in HTML by hand any more. 
      But it is a fun to do it, give it a try.
    <p>
      It is easy to fall into the traps of convoluted data processing tools
      and workflow the same way as playing with complicatd data format.
      These distractions divert our precious attentions to <i>meta data</i>
      from real data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Content management is a totally different domain than writing.
      It is a rabit hole that leads to an industry to solve meta data problems.
      In this domain, meta data is the real data.
      My previous day job was in CMS, fighting with meta data is our job.
