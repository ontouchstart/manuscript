    As a runner and engineer, I am fascinated about "runtime", a term
    that have different meanings to different people, or what they are
    doing.
  </p>
  <p>
    To a runner, it means time spent on running. To a software engineer,
    it means the state of running software.
  </p>
  <p>
    How would a software engineer who is also a runner understand
    runtime?  This is a question I asked myself when I spent hours on
    running or running software.
