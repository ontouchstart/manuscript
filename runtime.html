    Runtime

    <p>
      As a runner and engineer, I am fascinated about "runtime", a term
      that have different meanings to different people, or what they are
      doing.
    <p>
      To a runner, it means time spent on running. To a software engineer,
      it means the state of running software.
    </p>
    <p>
      How would a software engineer who is also a runner understand
      runtime?  This is a question I asked myself when I spent hours on
      running or running software.
    <p>
      A crucial idea of "run" is movement, or change of state. Whether
      in running or computer runtime, if you stop running, there is no
      state change and therefore no runtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrary to mathematical theorems and computer code, which are
      stateless and static. If a theorem is proved, it is true regardless
      of time. If a piece of computer program code passed the compiler,
      it should always pass the same compiler. Code is data, data is
      timeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if the compiler runtime changed, for example, it is updated
      to a different version of the language which has different rules,
      the old code might not compile. The code is not runtime. It passed
      at a moment in history and history is data, not runtime. History
      is immutable.
