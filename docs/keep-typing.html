    Keep Typing (2026/01/20)

    Keep typing. If we need a new paragraph, wrap it with <code>&lt;p&gt; ... &lt;p/&gt;</code> tags.
    <p>
      It is not that complicated.

      What is a manuscript? Based on Wikipedia (I am not going to add link here because this page is meant for reading
      on some off-line device like the kindle scribe. You can easily take out your smart phone and let your AI agent 
      do the work without breaking the flow), the word is derived from latin, <i>manūscriptum</i>: <i>manus</i> (hand) 
      and <i>scriptum</i> from <i>scribere</i> (to write). So a manuscript is made by the author "by hand", for themselves 
      and their editors.

      A writer should put more effort and time in thinking about and compose than 
      falling into the rabbit hole of styling, formatting and publishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we ignore most of the styling (including structure styling like heading,
      listing, etc), only keep essential tags such as 
      <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>,
      <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>,
      <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>,
      <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>, and
      <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>,
      The HTML would be much simpler and easy to parse by human and machine.
      We don't even need the extra step of <i>markdown</i> which is popular now
      for documentation and LLM.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is as easy to fall into the traps of convoluted data processing tooling
      as complicatd data format.
