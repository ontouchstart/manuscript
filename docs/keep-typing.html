    Keep Typing (2026/01/20)

    Keep typing. If we need a new paragraph, wrap it with <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags.
    <p>
      It is not that complicated.

      What is a manuscript? Based on Wikipedia (I am not going to add link here because this page is meant for reading
      on some off-line device like the kindle scribe. You can easily take out your smart phone and let your AI agent 
      do the work without breaking the flow), the word is derived from latin, <i>manūscriptum</i>: <i>manus</i> (hand) 
      and <i>scriptum</i> from <i>scribere</i> (to write). So a manuscript is made by the author "by hand", for themselves 
      and their editors.

    <p>
      A writer at writing stage should put effort in thinking and composing than 
      fighting through the rabbit hole of <i>styling</i>, <i>formatting</i> 
      and <i>publishing</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we ignore most of the styling (including structure styling like heading,
      listing, etc), only keep essential tags such as 
      <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>,
      <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>,
      <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>,
      <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>, and
      <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>,
      The HTML would be much simpler and easy to parse by human and machine.
      We don't even need the extra step of <i>markdown</i> which is popular now
      for documentation and LLM.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is as easy to fall into the traps of convoluted data processing tooling
      as complicatd data format.
    </p>
    <p>
      Content management is a different problem than writing. It is another rabit hole
      that needs an industry. (My previous day job was in CMS.)
