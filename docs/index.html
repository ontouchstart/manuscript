    Keep typing. If we need a new paragraph, wrap it with <code>&lt;p&gt; ... &lt;p/&gt;</code> tags.

      It is not that complicated.

      What is a manuscript? Based on Wikipedia (I am not going to add link here because this page is meant for reading
      on some off-line device like the kindle scribe. You can easily take out your smart phone and let your AI agent 
      do the work without breaking the flow), the word is derived from latin, <i>manūscriptum</i>: <i>manus</i> (hand) 
      and <i>scriptum</i> from <i>scribere</i> (to write). So a manuscript is made by the author "by hand", for themselves 
      and their editors.
