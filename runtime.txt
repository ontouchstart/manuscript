As a runner and engineer, I am fascinated about "runtime", a term
that have different meanings to different people, or what they are
doing.

To a runner, it means time spent on running. To a software engineer,
it means the state of running software.

How would a software engineer who is also a runner understand
runtime?  This is a question I asked myself when I spent hours on
running or running software.
