Mathematicians vs Engineers

"Von Neumann's approach was to bring a handful of engineers into a
den of mathematicians, rather than a handful of mathematicians into
a den of engineers. This freed the project from any constraints
that might have been imposed by an established group of engineers
with preexisting opinions as to how a computer should be built."

--- Georgy Dyson, "Turing's Cathedral".
