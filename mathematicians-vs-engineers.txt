Mathematicians vs Engineers

"Von Neumann's approach was to bring a handful of engineers into a
den of mathematicians, rather than a handful of mathematicians into
a den of engineers. This freed the project from any constraints
that might have been imposed by an established group of engineers
with preexisting opinions as to how a computer should be built."

--- Georgy Dyson, "Turing's Cathedral".

"The MANIAC’s logical architecture was indisputably the work of
Burks, Goldstine, and von Neumann, whatever their ideas’ original
source. Its physical implementation was indisputably the work of
Bigelow, and its electronic design was largely the result of teamwork
between Bigelow, Pomerene, Rosenberg, Slutz, and Ware."

"Go ahead, nothing else matters, get it running at this speed and
this capability, and the rest of it is just a lot of nonsense."

"You could never tell whether he was doing it because he was seeking
perfection or because he was worried about reliability."
