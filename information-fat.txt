Information Fat

I have been catching up with reading during the precious downtime
between jobs, on a large Kindle Scribe that allows me to read full
screen PDF.  The other day I was rereading "The Story of the Human
Body: Evolution, Health, and Disease" by Daniel E. Lieberman (2013).
I jumped to Part III, Chapter 10: The Vicious Circle of Too Much
(location 4207 of 11,117 | 38%). It has some interesting discussion
about how human species became so efficient at storing energy as
body fat due to natual selection and why obesity becomes an issue
in modern days due to low quality high energy diet.  This is the
knowledge I already had when I started long distance running since
COVID.

During lunch break I went to Hacker News and got sucked into a
rabbit hole about "Claude's Constitution" (You can search it on
Hacker News if you are curious, this page has no link capability.),
with more than 500 comments and someone posted links to more documents
about the background of the document they are discussing about.
Out of curiosity, I downloaded related documents and open them on
Kindle Scribe with the smallest font, Claude's Constitution (ePub)
has 1,1584 locations, Claude's Constitution (PDF) has 84 pages,
arXiv:2212.08073v1 [cs.CL] 15 Dec 2022 has 34 pages, Claude 4.5
Opus Soul Document (gist) has 1,736 locations.

I can't help noticing that each these documents is about 1/10 of a
full book. They do take a lot of energy to create and consume. I
am sure the percentage of people who commented on that Hacker News
rabbit hole and actually read through at least one of those three
documents is very small, our brain just don't have energy to consume
that amount of information.  I have spent weeks to finish the
Lieberman book and I am sure it took years for Dr. Lieberman to
write it.

We are in the age of cheap low quality information, nobody has
energy to digest and so we just store them everywhere as information
fat.
